# Web Projects- Hosted on my Website!
[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/KasperGam/webProjects/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/KasperGam/webProjects/tree/develop)

Central location for all one off web projects hosted on my website.

Contains one folder for each project, which will be built and pushed to s3/dynamoDB using a CircleCI with Fastlane pipeline.

Projects are small inspired games, simulations, or other cool things I wanted to build for myself!
